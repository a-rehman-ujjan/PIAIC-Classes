# TypeScript Learning Journey

Welcome to the TypeScript Learning Journey! This README provides an overview of the topics covered in each class.

ðŸ“š **Note:** This README is a work in progress. As more classes are covered, I will continue updating the file with detailed summaries, topics, and assignments. Stay tuned for comprehensive insights into TypeScript and web development concepts!


## Class 1: Introduction to TypeScript and Web Concepts

- **`TypeScript Introduction:`** TypeScript is a programming language that builds upon JavaScript by adding static type-checking and other features. It enhances code quality and helps catch errors early in development.
- **`Web Concepts:`** Understand the evolution from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 to Web 3.0: These terms refer to different stages in the evolution of the World Wide Web. Web 1.0 was the static web of early days, Web 2.0 brought interactive and social elements, and Web 3.0 aims to create a more intelligent, decentralized web.
- **`Introduction to Next.js:`**  Next.js is a popular React framework for building web applications. It enhances React with features like server-side rendering and routing.
- **`Serverless Technology:`** Serverless computing allows developers to focus on writing code without managing server infrastructure. It automatically scales based on demand.
- **`Assignments:`** Install development tools and console log "Hello, World!" using TypeScript.

## Class 2: TypeScript Fundamentals

- **`Programming Environment Setup:`** Configure [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en), [`Visual Studio Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download) to create a development environment.
- **`Variables In Typescript:`** Variables in TypeScript are named containers for holding data. To use them, declare with `let`, `const`, or `var`, assign values, and manipulate as needed
- **`Primitive Data Types:`** Explore string, number, boolean, undefined, Symbol, BigInt, and null types.
- **`Template Literals:`**  Creating strings with embedded expressions for easier concatenation and formatting.
- **`Operators In Typescript:`** Using arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators to manipulate values.
- **`Assignments:`** Complete assignments related to variables, types, and operators.

## Class 3: Functions, Arrays, and User Input

- **`Prompt Library:`** Learn how to take user input using the [Prompt library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt).
- **`Functions in TypeScript:`** Functions in TypeScript are named code blocks used to encapsulate and reuse sets of instructions, enhancing code organization and maintainability.
- **`Array in TypeScript:`** Explore creating and manipulating arrays for data storage.
- **`Assignments:`** Implement a grading system using functions and arrays.

## Class 4: Conditional Statements and Loops

- **`Return Type Annotations and Arrow Functions:`** Learn about specifying return types and using arrow functions.
- **`Conditional Statements:`** Explore using `if`, `else`, and `else if` statements for decision-making.
- **`Nested Statements:`** Understand how to nest conditional statements for more complex scenarios.
- **`Introduction to Arrays:`** Delve deeper into arrays as a powerful data structure.
- **`For Loops:`** Learn how to use `for` loops to iterate through collections.
- **`Assignments:`** Solve assignments related to implementing conditional statements and loops.
  - ### [Class 4 Code](https://github.com/usmanashrf/typescript-batch48/tree/main/Morning-section/class-4)

## Class 5: Modules and Asynchronous Operations

- **`CommonJS Modules vs. ECMA Modules:`** Understand the differences between these module systems.
- **`Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Operations:`** Learn about operations that run asynchronously or synchronously.
- **`Inquirer and Chalk Libraries:`** Introduce the Inquirer and Chalk libraries for enhanced user interactions and console output.
- **`Assignments:`** Complete assignments related to modules and understanding asynchronous operations.
- **`Further Learning:`** For more information, you can explore the [Inquirer documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and [Chalk documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk).

## Class 6: Advanced TypeScript Concepts and Package Management

- **`TypeScript Unions and Type Literals:`** Combine types and define specific values.
- **`TypeScript Objects:`** Create objects representing real-world entities.
- **`NPM and Package Management:`** Understand NPM's role in managing dependencies.
- **`Assignments`:** Publish previous assignments on npmjs.com and verify their functionality.
